Feature: Landing Page
	As a developer
	I want SA employees to be greeted when they visit the site
	So that they have a good shift
	
	Scenario: User see the landing page
		When I go to the landing page
    Then I should see "Hello"
    Then I should see "Welcome to the Binghamton Student Association Timesheet System"
